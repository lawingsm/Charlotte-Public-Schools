This project focuses on Public Schools located in Charlotte, NC. The schools shown are either regular, magnet or some variation of the two. 
I found the records from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools and used geojson.io to pin the locations. The polygon included is Income in 
Charlotte-based on Block Groups. The goal was to show the relationship between public schools and income in Charlotte.
